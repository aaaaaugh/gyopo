My mother keeps a journal of her time in America, which she's recently started publishing as a blog with photographs she's taken of her various garden over the years.

Gyopo Woman has an engaged and dedicated audience who share stories about their lives as Korean immigrants in the United States.

The entries span her interests, which include Native American art, gardening, and Buddhist literature. 

She does not write about her children because she cannot stand the credentialism of Korean Americans.

Her son writes for The New York Times. 

Her daughter is a surgeon.

She sees no reason to point these things out.

Instead, she has taken on the persona of a lonely immigrant on a farm, which I suppose she is.

>Here is an entry:

A long time ago, I had a book called Throwing It Away, Leaving It All Behind, by the great Korean Buddhist monk Bopjong. A friend had given it to me, suggesting I read it when I was feeling lonely. 

This monk had become famous only after I'd left Korea in the '70s, so I approached his book completely blind, ignorant of his public image or social achievements, instead reading through it without prejudice, as though it were a conversation between two people sitting across from each other, naked, one-on-one, author and reader. 

I recall that the author's intended theme was a life of solitude and musoyu [nonattachment] in the forest, free from greed and unbeholden to worldly relationships.

When I am in the midst of neighbors or crowds, I can feel the effects of the absence of language - some missing connection to the climate and sensibilities of my formative years. THe first ten-odd years were the peak of this vacuum state, marked by a muffling of the ears. Even at gatherings where I was surrounded by people, I was often in absolute solitude. With the passage of time, English, once little more than noise, bored through my ears until I could understand it, at least in my head. But its wavelengths were too short and faint to travel from the ear to the heart, to make my skin quiver and my hair stand on end, to turn into splitting smiles or tears. 

In my twenties in Korea, enveloped by the boundless plentitude of language, I would take fresh words that had just grown into themselves and sing the joys, anger, and sorrows of tumultuous youth until they had became a thick, rich soup; upon tiring of the pleasures of speech, I would abbreviate self-expression and communication into silence and poetry. 

One day, my language, abruptly severed in a foreign land, became sealed off inside of me, where it suffocated, and in the deafness of insensibility, I was absolutely lonely. 

To save my dying mouth, ears, head, heart, smile, tears, frisson, and skin, I frantically became a child again to relearn the burbling of English. 

My short and impoverished new language changed me.

In conversation, I spared my words, spoke forthrightly, was unable to make puns, always pressed to communicate intent, and I presented myself simply as I was. That attitude became entrenched in my speech and my way of thinking. Now my English has gained some color, sprouted new flesh, and can provoke sentiment, and although I have the leeway to wordlessly understand and respond with facial expressions, my impoverished habits of language remain. 

On the other hand, at a certain point, I've somehow become unable to bear people who are alone, now inclined to approach them. Without exception, they become good friends of mine. This is the precious blessing that the solitude of my immigrant life has quietly delivered to me.
